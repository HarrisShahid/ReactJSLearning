The README.md in each branch will tell you what you need to do in order to get to a state that is (hopefully) equal to that branch. If anything doesn't work, just compare your files to the ones in the branch. If your really can't figure it out, just checkout that branch and run it locally and play with it for a while, then move on to the next branch.
